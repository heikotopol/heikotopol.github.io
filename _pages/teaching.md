Summary of my teaching activities at Beijing Jiaotong University (**BJU**), Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (**CMU-Q**), New Uzbekistan University (**NewUU**), Qatar University (**QU**),
Ruhr University Bochum (**RUB**), and RWTH Aachen University (**RWTH**). At these institutions, I taught the following courses:

* <ins>_Mechanics I - Statics_ (**Mech. I**)</ins>: This is a foundational course in mechanical engineering that focuses on the study of forces, moments, and their effects on bodies at rest or in equilibrium. The course introduces the principles of vector mechanics and applies them to analyze and solve problems related to rigid bodies, structures, and mechanical systems. Key topics include the equilibrium of particles and rigid bodies, free-body diagrams, centroids, moments of inertia, and the analysis of trusses, frames, and beams.

* <ins>_Mechanics II - Mechanics of Materials_ (**Mech. II**)</ins>: This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles of the mechanics of materials, focusing on how materials respond to various types of loading. Topics include stress, strain, and deformation of materials under tension, compression, torsion, and bending. 

* <ins>_Mechanics III - Dynamics_ (**Mech. III**)</ins>: This course introduces the principles of motion and the forces that affect bodies in motion. This course covers the kinematics and kinetics of particles and rigid bodies, exploring concepts such as Newtonâ€™s laws of motion, energy and momentum methods, and the application of these principles to engineering systems.

* <ins>_Mechanical Modeling of Composites I & II_ (**MMoC**)</ins>

* <ins>_Differential and Integral Calculus_ (**21-120**)</ins>: This course introduces the fundamental concepts of calculus, focusing on both differential and integral calculus. Students will explore the principles of limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration of functions of one variable. Key topics include techniques of differentiation, applications of derivatives in optimization and motion problems, as well as methods of integration, such as substitution and integration by parts.

* <ins> _Multivariate Analysis_ (**21-256**)</ins>: This course provides a comprehensive exploration of mathematical techniques used in the analysis of functions of several variables. Key topics include vector calculus, partial differentiation, and multiple integrals.

* <ins>_Biomechanics Seminar_ (**BioSem**)</ins>: In this course, different research works related to biomechanics are analyzed.

*  <ins>_Biomechanics and Mechanobiology for soft biological tissues_ (**BMSBT**)</ins>: This course explores the fundamental principles of biomechanics and mechanobiology as applied to soft biological tissues, such as muscles, skin, blood vessels, and connective tissues. It combines mechanical engineering concepts with biological systems to understand how mechanical forces influence tissue development, growth, and repair. Key topics include the mechanical properties of soft tissues, stress-strain relationships, viscoelasticity, and the role of mechanotransduction in cellular behavior.

*  _Basics of the Biomechanics of the Musculoskeletal System_  (**BBMS**)

*  <ins>_Machine Elements_ (**ME**)</ins>:  This course introduces students to the fundamental principles and practices of mechanical design, focusing on the analysis, selection, and application of standard components used in machinery. Topics include the design of shafts, bearings, gears, fasteners, springs, and couplings, with an emphasis on strength, fatigue, and failure criteria. The course also covers material selection, safety factors, and the integration of these elements into larger mechanical systems. 

* <ins> _Fluid Mechanics_   (**FM**)</ins>: This course, Fluid Mechanics, introduces the fundamental principles governing fluid behavior and flow dynamics, essential for solving engineering problems in mechanical systems. The course covers fluid statics, fluid dynamics, and the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy

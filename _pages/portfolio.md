My research interests can be divided into the following parts:

# Mechanoregulated Remodeling of Collagen

_Biomechanics_ is the study of the mechanical properties, the function, and the motion of biological systems.
This field of science combines different aspects of engineering and biology in order to gain a deeper insight into the properties of living materials.
My biomechanics research focuses on the mechanical properties of collagenous soft tissue. 
Experiments have shown that strain may stabilize collagen fibers to enzyamtic degradation (see [Topol et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4052752)). This effect has been modeled in my articles.<br/>

# Bifurcation of pressurized Cylinders

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are responsible for a large number of deaths in industrialized countries.
This motivation many researchers to develop models that capture the formation, development, and rupture of aneurysms.
The geometry, mechanical properties, and numerous biochemical processes play an important role in the formation of dilatations in arteries.
My work studies instabilities in loaded and inflated cylinders with the application to the formation and propagation of aneurysms in arterial wall tissue.<br/>




# Mechanical Properties of Composites
## Transport Properties of Composites

My work on the mechanical behavior of composites deals with wave propagation and  heat transfer in anisotropic media.
This research applied different methods such as the _Floquet-Bloch approach_, the _plane wave expansion method_, the _asymptotic homogenization method_, and the _transfer-matrix method_ in order to understand the properties of composites ([Andrianov et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1002/zamm.201000176), [Andrianov et al. (2017a)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00707-016-1765-4), [Andrianov et al. (2017b)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.03.124), [Andrianov et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wavemoti.2017.12.007)).

## Stress Distribution in Loaded Composites
In composites, an important method to determine the mechanical properties of the material is the pull-out tests of fibers from matrix. 
The quality of bonding between two constituents have a crucial role in the functionality of the material.
There are numerous factors that lead to imperfect bonding such as cracks, corrosion, or degradation.
Methods that help to understand the development of the mechanical properties with ongoing damage processes guarantees
an efficient use of composites.
There are different techniques at account for imperfect bonding between constituents ([Andrianov et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00419-008-0265-y), [Andrianov et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wavemoti.2017.12.007), [Andrianov et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00707-020-02634-6)).
* A popular model is denoted as the _spring-layer model_, in which spings simulate the bonding conditions between the fibers and the matrix.
* An alternative for modeling imperfect bonding is to introduce one or multiple _artificial modeling layer_ between two constituents. These layers are taken to be thin in comparison to the thickness of the fibers. The geometry and the elastic proeprties of the modeling layer define the bonding wuality between the fibers and the matrix.

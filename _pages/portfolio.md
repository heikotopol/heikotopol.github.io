My research interests can be divided into the following parts:

### Mechanoregulated Remodeling of Collagen

_Biomechanics_ is the study of the mechanical properties, the function, and the motion of biological systems.
This field of science combines different aspects of engineering and biology in order to gain a deeper insight into the properties of living materials.
My biomechanics research focuses on the mechanical properties of collagenous soft tissue. 
Experiments have shown, that strain maiy stabilize collagen fibers to enzyamtic degradation (see [Topol et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4052752)). This effect has been modeled in my articles.


Abdominal aortic aneurysms are responsible for a large number of deaths in industrialized countries.
This motivation many researchers to develop models that capture the formation, development, and rupture of aneurysms.
The geometry, mechanical properties, and numerous biochemical processes play an important role in the formation of dilatations in arteries.
My work studies instabilities in loaded and inflated cylinders with the application to the formation and propagation of aneurysms in arterial wall tissue.



### Transport Properties of Composites

My work on the mechanical behavior of composites deals with wave propagation and  heat transfer in anisotropic media.
This research applied different methods such as the _plane wave expansion method_, the _asymptotic homogenization method_, and the _Floquet-Bloch approach_ in order to understand the properties of composites.

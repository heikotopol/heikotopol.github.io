I am a mechanical engineer who works in different fields of mechanics such as continuum mechanics, biomechanics of fibrous soft tissue, wave propagation in anisotropic media, and homogenization. I have studied and worked in Germany, USA, China, and Qatar. Now I am back in Germany and I work at the [Institute of General Mechanics](https://www.iam.rwth-aachen.de/) of RWTH Aachen University.

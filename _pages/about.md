About me
======

After receiving my engineering degree at _Ruhr University Bochum_, I became a PhD student at _RWTH Aachen University_, where I worked together with 
[Igor V. Andrianov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4BW4P2AAAAAJ&hl=en),
[Vladyslav V. Danishevskyy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1r-_5HwAAAAJ&hl=en), and
[Dieter Weichert](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Weichert) in the fields of the mechanics of composites, wave propagation in anisotropic media, and asymptotic homogenization.

In 2013 I moved to Qatar, where I worked at _Qatar University_ and at _Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar_, where in worked together with [Hasan Demirkoparan](https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/directory/hasan-demirkoparan/) (_Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar_), [Thomas J. Pence](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~pence/) (_Michigan State University_), [Alan Wineman](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/alan-wineman) (University of Michigan), and [Kun Gou](https://apps.tamusa.edu/course-information/Profile/Faculty/387?=Kun-Gou) (Texas A&M University San Antonio) in order to explore the biomechanics of fibrous soft tissue.
In the fall of 2020 I became a visiting assistant professor of mathematical sciences at _Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar_

Now I am back at the [Institute of General Mechanics](https://www.iam.rwth-aachen.de/) of _RWTH Aachen University_, where I continue my biomechanics work.

A continuum mechanics constitutive model is presented for the interaction between swelling and collagen remodeling in biological soft tissue. The model is inherently two-way: swelling stretches the collagen fibers which affects their rate of degradationâ€”the remodeled fibrous microarchitecture provides selective directional stiffening that causes the swollen tissue to expand more in the unreinforced directions. The constitutive model specifically treats stretch-stabilization wherein the rate of enzymatic-induced degradation of collagen is a decreasing function of fiber stretch. New collagen replacement takes place in a generally swollen environment, and this synthesis is tracked as a function of time by means of a time integration scheme that accounts for the historical sequence of collagen recreation. The model allows for the specification of the collagen pre-stretch at the time of first synthesis, thus allowing for the consideration of either initially limp replacement fiber or initially pre-tensioned replacement fiber. Loading and swelling that occurs on time scales that are commensurate with the natural time scales for fiber degradation and replacement lead to the consideration of time-integral constitutive equations. Loading and swelling that take place on time scales that are very different from that of the remodeling time scales provide a simplified treatment in which there are definite notions of a short-time instantaneous response and also a large-time approach to a steady-state condition of homeostasis.

In this paper we study wave propagation through a composite material built up of a periodically repeated one-dimensional structure of coated inclusions and matrix material by the application of the asymptotic homogenization method. We take into account geometrical nonlinearity, which is described by the Cauchy-Green strain tensor and physical nonlinearity by the Murnaghan elastic potential. We take into account structural nonlinearity by considering the bonding between two materials to be imperfect. As a result we obtain homogenized equations for the low-frequency range.

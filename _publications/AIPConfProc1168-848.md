We present an application of the Floquet‐Bloch approach to the study of wave dispersion in periodic viscoelastic composite materials. Solution is obtained by expanding spatially varying properties of a composite medium in Fourier series and representing unknown displacement fields by infinite plane‐wave expansions. The dispersion curves are obtained, the pass and stop frequency bands are identified.

abstract = {This paper deals with applying two main sensitivity analysis (SA) methods, namely, the Sobol method and the Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) method on the problem of mixed extension, inflation, and torsion of a circular cylindrical tube in the presence of residual stress. The mechanical side of the problem was previously proposed by Merodio & Ogden (2016). The input parameters in the form of the initial cylinder geometry, the amount of the residual stress, the azimuthal stretch, the axial elongation, and the torsional strain are distributed according to three probability distribution methods, namely the uniform, the gamma, and the normal distribution. In the present work, through applying Sobol and FAST methods, the most influential factors among input parameters on the output variable have been determined. The assessment of our results is then determined by the computation of bias and standard deviation of Sobol and FAST indices for each input parameter in the model.}

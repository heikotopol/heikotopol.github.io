    abstract = { We consider a tubular membrane whose mechanical behavior is defined by a strain energy density function that combines the neo-Hookean model with the Demiray model. Both, the neo-Hookean and the Demiray models are isotropic material models, which found their application in the modeling of the mechanical behavior of biological soft tissue. This tubular membrane is subjected to an inner pressure, an axial stretch, and a change in the material volume due to swelling or deswelling. The interplay between the cylinder geometry and the loading conditions and different instability modes, namely, bulging bifurcation, bending bifurcation, and prismatic bifurcation, are studied. It is shown that a change in the material volume has a strong effect on the occurrence of these bifurcation modes because a change in the material volume may stabilize the cylinder against a particular bifurcation mode and may trigger another bifurcation mode at the same time. Despite the restriction to isotropic material behavior, this article shows that the material response to pressure, axial stretch, and material volume change is quite complex. }

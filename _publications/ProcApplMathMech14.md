An important challenge in the field of biomechanics is to understand and to model the properties of fibrous tissues. We consider a matrix-fiber composite for which the matrix microstructure and its mechanical properties are taken to be constant. The initial fiber distribution is assumed to be unstructured and the mechanical properties of the fibers evolve during deformation. Further we assume that the fiber creation rate is constant while the fiber degeneration is stretch-dependent. In particular, this study investigates the change of the fiber orientation density when a sudden simple shear is applied to the material. The fiber orientation density depends on the current deformation, the history of the deformation, and the deformation state of the fibers at the time of their creation.

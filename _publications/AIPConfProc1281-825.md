The load‚Äêtransfer from a periodical system of fibres to a physically nonlinear layer is herein investigated. We consider a set of cylindrical fibres weakly bonded to a matrix layer and use a composite cylinder assemblage model. The matrix is coated by a thin elastic layer rigidly bonded to the boundaries of the matrix. We treat this coating as an inextensible membrane ideally bonded to the matrix. We propose an asymptotic model consisting of a multilayered interface with thin components. The obtained results are used for the investigation of the fracture of composite materials.

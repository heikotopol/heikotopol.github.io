In a fibre-reinforced 2D composite material with elastic fibres and viscoelastic, isotropic matrix is studied. Starting from the solution of a reference-problem with elastic matrix material the elastic matrix parameters are substituted by their viscoelastic correspondents in the Laplace domain. For simplification the time-dependent solution is approximated by using limiting value theorems that give information about the time-dependent solution for t → 0 and t → ∞. Then the method of asymptotically equivalent functions is used and illustrated with examples of a steel fibre in a PMMA matrix. The analytical solutions are compared with their numerical counterparts. In summary it can be stated that this paper is a further contribution to the vast literature about the application of the correspondence principle to the solution of special problems of the linear viscoelasticity.

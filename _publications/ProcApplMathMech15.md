We consider a biological fibrous soft tissue in which fibers are distributed in all directions. The mechanical properties of the fibers evolve due to a continuous remodeling process. The model to describe these fiber properties is based on the strain energy density of the protofibers and a survival kernel which describes the deformation-related property changes. In particular, this study investigates the development of the fiber orientation density for different choices of the fiber creation rate and fiber dissolution rate models. It has been shown that the fiber orientation density depends on both the history of the deformation and the deformation state of the fibers at the time of their creation..
